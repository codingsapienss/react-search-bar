# react-search-bar
live demo : https://imprsant-autosearch.netlify.app/

This is a very simple and small project of auto-search in react made with the help of vite.
In this project if you type any string in search-bar, a list of suggested keywords will automatically generated that contains the typed string.
For this project, I have used jsonplaceholder api from where the list of suggested keyword is fetched.
